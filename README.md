## About

- Self-(de)spawning node system which allows for procedurally generated levels with multiple paths and bidrectional travel.
- Traps and other obstacles which are spawned from random groupings.
- Features in C++ traditionally done in Blueprints, such as Timelines and UMG.

## Building

You will not be able to build the full game from this source code, as there are 3D models and other assets which have been privately licensed. These are simply the parent classes of naked child Blueprints that specify such assets to use and other variables. However the code is available for study and use in your own games.

## Mobile is bad

Mobile as a 3D gaming platform is terrible for many reasons. Here's a few:

1. Graphics have to be reduced to lowest settings for smooth FPS, even on high end phones.
2. Battery life is impossible to spare.
3. You can only clutter the screen with so many inputs.
